==============

Sortable lists for Ember.js.

[JSBin Example](http://jsbin.com/hicineku/4) -- [JSBin example with binding](http://jsbin.com/hicineku/5)

Usage
-----

Simply include the `ti-sortable-list.{amd,cjs,global}.js` file your in favorite asset pipeline, or copy/paste, or whatever you like.

Then, just use the component:

```handlebars
{{#ti-ember-sortable items=links class="items__list" action="save"}}
  {{#each link in links}}
	<li>
      <i class="handle">Move</i>
      {{input value=link.label}}
    </li>
  {{/each}}
{{/ti-ember-sortable}}
```

If you are using ember-cli or ember-app-kit, you will need to use an initializer like so:

```
//In your Brocfile.js
app.import('node_modules/ti-ember-sortable/dist/ti-ember-sortable.amd.js', {
  exports: {
    'ti-ember-sortable': ['default']
  }
});
```

```javascript
import EmberSortable from 'ti-ember-sortable';

export default {
  name: 'ti-ember-sortable',
  initialize: function(container, application) {
    container.register('component:ti-ember-sortable', EmberSortable);
  }
};
```

Options:
--------

You can specify a handle selector via `{{#ti-ember-sortable handle="selector.goes.here"}}`. By default this is set to `.handle`.

You can also specify the draggable selector via `{{#ti-ember-sortable draggableSelector="selector.goes.here"}}`. By default this is set to `li`.

Finally, you can specify the class name of the 'ghost' that gets created while dragging via `{{#ti-ember-sortable ghostClass="class-goes-here"}}` By default this is `sortable-ghost`.

ps. as with all components, you can specify `tagName` and `class`.

Rationale
---------

There are a lot of list sorting libraries out there. Most of them blow up with Ember.js due to the metamorph script tags Ember adds to DOM for databinding:

When you use most of the list sorting libraries out there, the list ends up looking like so:

We do some fancy legwork to remove and reattach correctly, ensuring databinding works great post-sort, but really all the heavy lifting is done by [Sortable](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable).

TODO
----

Tests!

Now that `metal-views` is out, metamorphs are removed and a lot of this code could probably be cleaned up.
